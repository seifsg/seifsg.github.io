Hi!
I started freelancing in 2010 and did many projects to clients from around the globe. Mostly done on their production sites.
I didn't log any of it so it resulted in me losing all my work records.
I made this site so that I can prove my work to myself and to my clients.
In the creation of this website I used:
*Materializecss
*jQuery
*fontawesome
*picture from google that are labeled free for commercial use
This site shall be updated daily.
